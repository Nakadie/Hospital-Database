This is a sample project that I have worked on that is able to take inputs for a new patient and store it in a text file database I created then locate patients in the database to display their data. 

I realize that SQL is a better database handling tool but at the time of completing the project I was under time constraints to push the project out quickly. I imporovised a workable database using the knowlege I already have. I deliberately wrote my classes so that I will be able to implement SQL at a later date. 

Possible future updates will be: 
- Time stamped notes under patients file.
- SQL upgrade.
- Ability to list all patients and select from a list.
- Edit existing patients.



Known issues being worked on:
- Patients who have the same last name cannot be differentiated. 
- Sex not being displayed correctly. ### fixed ###
- Name case sensitivity changes.



Here is a demo of the project.
