This is a sample project that I have worked on that is able to take inputs for a new patient and store it in a 
text file then locate patients in the database to display their data. 

I realize that SQL is a better database handling tool but at the time of completing the project I was not
familiar with SQL. I deliberately wrote my classes so that I will be able to implement SQL at a later date. 

Possible future updates will be: 
- Time stamped notes on patients.
- SQL upgrade.
- Ability to list all patients and select from a list.

Known issues being worked on:
- Patients who have the same last name cannot be differentiated. 
- Sex not being displayed correctly. ### fixed ###
